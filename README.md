## System Requirements

- Node.js v22.11.0 or higher
- npm v11.1.0 or higher
- React Native development environment
- Android Studio (for Android development)
- Xcode (for iOS development, macOS only)
- Firebase project setup (Auth, Firestore, Storage, Functions, Messaging)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/SamuraiPolix/Tori.git
cd Tori
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Firebase Setup

1. Create a new Firebase project at [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com)
2. Add your Android and iOS apps to the Firebase project
3. Download the configuration files:
   - `google-services.json` for Android (place in `src/services/`)
   - `GoogleService-Info.plist` for iOS (place in `src/services/`)
4. Enable the following Firebase services:
   - Authentication
   - Cloud Firestore
   - Cloud Storage

## Running the App

### Android

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In a new terminal, run on Android
npm run android
```

### iOS

```bash
# Start Metro bundler
npm start

# In a new terminal, run on iOS
npm run ios
```

## Running Multiple Emulators

To test both business and customer views simultaneously, you can run two emulators at the same time. Here's how:

### Starting Multiple Emulators

You can start multiple emulators either through command line or Android Studio:

#### Using Command Line:
```bash
# List available emulators
emulator -list-avds

# Start the first emulator
emulator -avd <Emulator_Name_1> &

# Start the second emulator
emulator -avd <Emulator_Name_2> &
```

#### Using Android Studio:
1. Open Android Studio
2. Go to Device Manager
3. Launch or duplicate an existing emulator
4. Start both emulators

### Verify Emulators
Check that both emulators are running:
```bash
adb devices
```

You should see something like:
```
List of devices attached
emulator-5554   device
emulator-5556   device
```

### Running the App on Both Emulators
Run these commands in separate terminals to start the app on each emulator:

```bash
# For the first emulator (e.g., for business view)
npx expo start --port 8082

# For the second emulator (e.g., for customer view)
npx expo start --port 8083
```

Then, press Shift + A to select the emulator on each terminal or open Expo Go on each emulator and you will see the Expo app running

This allows you to test business and customer interactions in real-time.
